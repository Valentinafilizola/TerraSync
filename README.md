# TerraSync
Physical computation final project

Project Concept / Motivation
One way I maintain motivation while working is by cultivating a clean and visually engaging environment. I have found that surrounding myself with meaningful objects such as small trinkets, warm lighting, and photographs of friends and family positively influences my focus and overall mindset. However, I wanted to design something that extends beyond aesthetics and serves a functional and motivational purpose. Terrasync emerged from this intention to create a physical object that not only enhances the visual quality of a workspace but also actively supports focus and environmental awareness. In addition, this project provides an opportunity to further develop my Unity skills and strengthen my technical fluency in interactive systems.

Terrasync is a small dome-shaped ambient desk lamp that integrates environmental sensing with a synchronized digital ecosystem in Unity. The physical form will resemble a compact terrarium dome, designed as a cohesive and intentional desktop object rather than an exposed electronics prototype. Inside, RGB LEDs will create a soft, diffused glow, while a photoresistor embedded on the side of the base will detect ambient light levels in the surrounding environment. The LED brightness will dynamically respond to room lighting, allowing the lamp to adapt naturally to its context. Through serial communication, the Arduino will transmit environmental data to a Unity application running as a small widget on the user’s laptop. The Unity interface will display a terrarium-like simulation that transitions between daytime and nighttime states based either on the real-world time of day or the brightness detected by the photoresistor, creating a synchronized relationship between the physical environment and the digital ecosystem.
In addition to environmental responsiveness, Terrasync introduces a focus interaction through a side-mounted button integrated into the enclosure. A single press activates Focus Mode, prompting a digital plant within the Unity terrarium to begin growing. Pressing the button again initiates a pause request, which is clearly displayed in the Unity widget to prevent accidental interruption. A second confirming press finalizes the pause and causes the growing plant to wither, visually representing a break in focus. This layered interaction should discourage unintentional disengagement while preserving user control. By combining ambient light adaptation with a tangible focus mechanism, Terrasync reframes productivity as something cultivated within an ecosystem rather than measured solely through timers.
